# popupInfra

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of popupInfra is to demonstrate how to find roads with 'spare lanes'.

The package was created in RStudio by clicking File > New Project and completing the form as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio-make-pkg.png")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
devtools::create(path = "popupInfra")
```

The code used to find how many lanes for motor traffic there are on roads in Santiago can be found in the file `code/santiago.R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("code")
file.edit("code/santiago.R")
```
