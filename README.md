The goal of popupInfra is to demonstrate how to find roads with ‘spare
lanes’.

The package was created in RStudio by clicking File \> New Project and
completing the form as follows:

The code used to find how many lanes for motor traffic there are on
roads in Santiago can be found in the file `code/santiago.R`.

``` r
dir.create("code")
file.edit("code/santiago.R")
```
